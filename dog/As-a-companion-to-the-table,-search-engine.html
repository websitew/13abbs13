<h2 id="2" >Agility Training for Australian Shepherds</h2>
<p>Australian shepherds require a lot of exercise and activity. They are most behaved when they have a job to perform. These dogs are very eager to learn tricks and/or go through agility training. Aussies are very intelligent dogs who always want to please their owner. If you decide not to train your australian shepherd, they will use their time to become destructive or test their limits of what they can and cannot do until properly trained.</p>
<p>Australian shepherds are very quick to learn, and will happily and easily pick up new tricks and commands. Again, exercise is crucial to their ability to focus and commit to training, and flyball and agility classes provide ideal settings to stimulate body and mind. They will find repetitive training dull and uninteresting, so owners must be prepared to provide variety and ample praise when attempting to teach new behaviours.</p>

<h3 id="3" >Belgian Shepherd's HERDING CUP</h3>
<p>Belgian shepherd is one of the breeds very commonly used for herding sheep, competing in traditional style. If you compare belgian’s working style with other shepherds, you soon realize it is very specific as well as the way of training a belgian for herding. Many of good breeders try to assure a strong characters of their litters and thus search for working abilities in their parents. This way the idea of holding a herding trial  for belgian shepherds was born, as a possibility for fans of this breed to meet up, compare their experience and abilities and most of all gain a motivation for further training with their dogs.</p>
<p>2019
?cz? / en
the third week of october 2019 was in the spirit of the fifth year of a special herding trial for belgian shepherds - the belgian shepherd's herding cup. This year was again held in a new location, this time competitors had the opportunity to test their dogs on lambs and young sheep in the hilly terrain of the pasture in budišov nad budišovkou. The trial pasture in budišov is divided in half by a line of trees, bushes and a slight slope, which served as a very interesting natural obstacle. The peak of autumn colored the leaves in gorgeous yellow and red colors.</p>
<h2 id="4" >Famous Australian Shepherds</h2>
<p>Australian shepherds, or “aussies” to their friends – which they make on every walk! – are sweet-natured, hard-working, energetic dogs. Despite their name, they’re actually an american breed, famous for working with cowboys and starring in movies and rodeos. Aussies arrived in the american west after a long journey around the world. Their ancestors, the pyrenean shepherds, came to australia with basque travelers from the north of spain. In the australian outback, the basques mated their herding dogs with collies from britain, producing the aussie we know and love today. Descendants of the basques then moved to california, where their dogs impressed the local cowboys with their intelligence, kindness, and loyalty.</p>
<p>If you are the proud owner of an australian shepherd puppy then you know there is not much cuter than the hilarious attempted bobbed tail wag of an aussie. The word “attempted” is a key part of the previous phrase as it tells you everything you need to know about the famous aussie wag. For most aussie dogs, a tail wag is more of a full-blown booty shake wherein they vigorously shake their entire hindquarters. This classic australian shepherd dog temperament is just one of the many fun facts about australian shepherds, but it begs the question, where’s the tail?.</p>
<p>Australian shepherds were made famous in the american west for being ready to tackle the demands of rugged terrain and big mountains. Now that you know a bit about the characteristics of the breed, it’s time to explain how some of these traits make them amazing adventure dogs.</p>
<p>The corgis are famous because of their celebrity parents queen elizabeth ii. She owned 14 generations of this dog. The dog named susan was the first corgi that she got as a present on her 18th birthday. Australian shepherds are also loved and owned by many other celebrities.</p>
<h3 id="5" >Popular Dog Breeds</h3>
<p>By anton hout, author of the guide to aussie training & care
flyball is one of the more exciting sports for dogs and their owners. Not only is it fast paced, making it perfect for high-energy breeds like the australian shepherd, but because it is a team sport it also allows for the opportunity to socialize with other dog owners. For these reasons, and as the thrill of competition increases, it is becoming one of the most popular sports worldwide.</p>
<p>The german shepherd ranks 2nd on the akc’s most popular list of 155 dog breeds. That means they come in right behind the labrador, and are perhaps even more impressive in their ranking, being that they’ve only been around in the states since the 1920’s. Perhaps they’re so popular because of their versatility. They’re fantastic companions, watchdogs, show dogs, police dogs, service dogs, and just about anything else that a dog can be (they’re trained for multiple different utilities).</p>

australian shepherd is a one of the most popular pure dog breed originated from united states. This is a medium-sized breed of dog also known as “aussie”. Like all working breeds, aussies have considerable energy and drive and usually need a job to keep them occupied.</p>
<p>The australian shepherd, often known simply as the "aussie", is a medium-sized breed of dog that was, despite its name, developed on ranches in the united states during the 19th century. There is disagreement regarding the exact history of the breed prior to its arrival in the united states, and thus no official consensus on the origin of its name or association with australia. They are similar in appearance to the popular english shepherd and border collie breeds, and research has found that australian shepherds and border collies are closely related to each other; both the border collie and australian shepherd are slightly more distantly related to other kinds of collies from the basque regions of europe.</p>
