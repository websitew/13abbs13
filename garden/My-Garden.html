<h2 id="2" >5 Ways to Entertain in Your Garden During the Winter</h2>
<p>It may be colder; the nights may draw in sooner and the weather might be more unpredictable but it doesn’t mean that your garden should become redundant during the winter. If you’ve spent a lot of time sprucing it up during the summer months, why shouldn’t you continue to show it off during the winter?
there are still plenty of ways you can enjoy your beautiful garden and make it the perfect place for entertaining even on a chilly winter evening. Here are just a few to get you started.</p>
<h3 id="3" >The Main Enemies of Trees</h3>
<p>Planting a hedge is one of the friendliest ways to put a border around a property. Unlike fences, shrubs take time to grow, allowing you to ease into defining your space. In addition to creating privacy, hedging is a great way to divide gardens, line the borders of a driveway, and adorn your home’s foundation. The culture of planting trees and shrubs in dense, interwoven lines dates back thousands of years to the fields of farmers who needed to pen livestock and shield tender crops from seaborne winds. In medieval days, dense thickets of thorny hawthorn kept enemies at bay.</p>
<p>Regularly check plants for signs of infestation. Encourage natural enemies like ladybirds, hoverflies, and lacewings to become established in the garden. Plant daisy-like flowers, yellow flowers, and the plant limnanthes douglasii. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides. These will kill beneficial insects (as well as aphids). Encourage insect-eating birds such as blue tits. Hang feeders in winter and hang nest boxes in spring. If you plant new apple trees, use rootstocks. Rootstocks are resistant to apple woolly aphids.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the emerald ash borer has few natural enemies in north america. In china, where the eab has lived for a long time, natural enemies of the beetle do exist. In addition, the trees there have developed more resistance to the beetle's damage than the ash trees in north america. Researchers have discovered three types of non-stinging, parasitic wasps that live in china and kill the eab beetles at different stages of their life cycle. The potentially helpful insects are called the oobius wasp, the tetrastrichus wasp, and the spathius wasp. The researchers have imported the wasps into the united states and have released them into the environment, after tests to see if they harm native beetles.</p>
<h2 id="4" >How to Care for Your Privacy & Screening Trees</h2>
<p>It seems that in nearly every garden we work in, the client needs some sort of screening somewhere in the garden. Whether it’s an urban garden needing privacy from neighbours, a country garden that needs to hide an oil tank, or even if a secluded area in the garden is required to house the hot-tub, there is something for every situation. Firstly, what is it that you are screening? this will determine what shape, size and type of screen you will need. If you are trying to hide an unsightly wall, fence or tank of some description, your screening will need to start at ground level, and therefore a hedge will most likely be required for this position.</p>
<p>Most evergreens require very little care. But before going out to purchase trees or shrubs for your garden, it's important to determine the purpose in your landscape. Do you want a windbreak for your house to reduce your electric bill? would you like screening and privacy from the neighbors? or will these trees be decorative, providing an anchor for your garden?3
since the trees come in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors and leaf types, understanding the purpose for which they'll be used will help determine the tree types that will work best in your yard. Although they survive in a wide variety of growing zones, most thrive in specific zones.</p>
<h3 id="5" >What are the Types of Privacy Trees for Sale?</h3>
<p>Privacy trees also serve as protection for wildlife. Since many are evergreens and thrive during cold, winter months, they play an important role in protecting the ecosystem and wildlife against the elements. If needed, our collection of screening trees for sale can also be used to add a windbreak and protect your property against harsh winds, storms, and other elements. There are many types of privacy trees for sale, and each one has its own unique characteristics. Before you make your decision, consider the following as you buy privacy trees online.</p>

<p>The dry landscape garden is the most widely known and most celebrated of japan’s gardening styles, and it invariably forms a part of the stereotypical image that most people associate with zen buddhism and the temples of kyoto. As a distinct garden style, the dry landscape traces its lineage to the heian period (794-1185), although its origins are lost in ancient shinto religious sites. In essence, the dry landscape garden is simply a symbolic representation of mountains and water using rocks, sand, gravel, and moss. Needless to say, such a venerable garden style has attracted a number of appellations.</p>
